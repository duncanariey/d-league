# What A Rollercoaster!

This is a python script that uses a few ESPN APIs to determine which NFL division had the most "exciting" games in a given week of the season, as measured by the sum of the deltas of team win percentage over the course of each game.

This is a passion project for a select few eccentric people and it is unlikely anyone outside that circle would find this at all useful. If you are a tech recruiter reviewing my github profile, I disavow all affiliation with professional sports and ensure you that my only interest in the NFL is Cleatus, the Fox Sports robot.
